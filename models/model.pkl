The file /automated-vision-system/automated-vision-system/models/model.pkl is a binary file that typically contains a serialized machine learning model. Since this file is not meant to contain text or code, it cannot be represented in a textual format. 

To create this file, you would typically use a machine learning library (like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch) to train a model and then save it using the appropriate method. For example, in scikit-learn, you would use `joblib.dump(model, 'model.pkl')` to save the model.

Therefore, the contents of the file are not directly representable in text format and would be generated by the model training process.
